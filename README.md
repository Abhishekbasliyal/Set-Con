# VIGILANCE:
## Our Student attention detection module

Based on the problem statement "How to create an online classroom experience where student behaviour can be monitored in real-time?". Submitted to StacksHack4Impact.

## Features
  * Frontend built in React/React native
  * Backend part uses Node.js and Express
  * Can be used on Android, iOS and web
  * Understands user messages and intentions using NLP (Natural Language Processing)
  * Uses REST APIs to provide relevant information to user
  * Deployed on Heroku

## Using the app

The application/project can be run on any Windows/Linux running device using python. Make sure to follow the steps below:
  * Firstly install the dependencies required to run the project. Run the command "pip install keras opencv-python imutils numpy" in command prompt.
  * Then using Spyder or PyCharm, run the "live_video.py" file, or using cmd, run the command "python live_video.py" to run the python file.
  * You may change the variable "use_live_video=True" to run the project on realtime webcam video, or provide a recorded video file to the model to process for the attentiveness/emotional analysis.
